How this Personal Profile
Benefits You

We live in an age where the pace of change is more rapid than at any time in 
history. In order to meet these challenges employers require and value people 
who are adaptable and able to be resilient.

This employability booklet should to be used as a reference to highlight your skills 
and attributes. Whether it be for academic purposes, such as creating a CV, or for 
personal endeavours into the world of work.

Step 1:
Making a start

‘failing to plan is planning to fail’

You can’t just ‘look for a job’.

Having a plan will help you get the most form your efforts. First ask yourself some basic questions

What have I got to offer?

Many people make the mistake and consider themselves unskilled because they don’t have much work experience or because they don’t know how to do anything else.
The following may help you think about skills you already have including leisure and social
activities and other things you have achieved.
Think about your activities and check whether you have skills or experience which could be useful in a new job.
For example, being a member of a sports team could involve the following:
•	Getting on well with other people
•	Following or giving instructions
•	Being committed to something (reliability)
•	Following a routine
•	Communication
•	Leadership skill

Knowing how to ‘sell’ yourself can make finding a job easier. Start by asking yourself honestly...

·	What skills do I have?
·	What are my attributes?
·	Can I use any of these skills in other jobs, are they transferable  skills?
·	Do I have any other skills connected with my hobbies or interests which I could develop?

Looking for jobs

The following are some of the places you use in your search for work.

Jobcentres

Easy to use and you won’t be charged to use the services. Check the vacancy cards on display. If you find anything suitable, the Jobcentre staff will be able to tell you how to apply.

Jobs displayed include full-time, permanent, part-time and temporary vacancies.
The Jobcentre also have details of training courses and other help which is available for unemployed people in the local area.

Newspapers

Both local and national papers advertise jobs but initially you might be better off looking in the local paper until you feel you have wider experience.

Employment agencies

Can be really helpful. These are now also based as online agencies but be- ware they may take a ‘finders fee’ from you—is it worth it and what is it?

Shop  windows/newsagents/Local Library

Really helpful for part time jobs in the local area—remember local people may know you or recognise you—what impression are you giving on your way home from school for example!

Social Media

As you gain more experience many companies are moving towards advertising employment opportunities through social media like Twitter, Linked In and Monster—what does your social media account say about you?

Step 3:

Word of mouth

Many vacancies are never advertised anywhere. One of the best ways of finding out about jobs is through people you know. Friends, relatives and other acquaintances may hear about existing vacancies or jobs not yet advertised.

Making ‘word of mouth’ work for you

THINK

Who could I get in touch with? Who might know of opportunities?
What about people I used to work with? Or friends from the past?
Relatives?
What are the pros and cons?

PLAN

What will I say?
What should I say I’m looking for? How can this person help me?

DO

List anyone you think may be able to help
Decide how to get in touch—phone, letter, in person, etc.

THEN

Follow up any requests to check any results Keep in touch (But try not to be pushy!)

Step 4:

Applying on the ‘off chance’

Many  vacancies  are  not advertised.

There is always a chance to find these jobs by applying on the ‘off chance’.

The chart below may help you to prepare for a visit or a telephone call to an employer.

Decide who to contact and why

Decide what to say - make notes beforehand

Find out the name of the person you should speak to

If you are going to use a mobile, be sure you have plenty of charge and credit available

Have pen and paper ready to make notes

If you are going to visit, get your paper- work together, e.g. copies of your CV, references, examples of work

Plan your journey - could you visit several employers?

Pay attention to your appearance - first impressions count Always arrive early!

Preparation of a CV

What is a CV?

Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a short factual account about yourself, including your work experience and qualifications. It should ideally be no more than two sides of A4. It should provide all potential employers with the essential information.

Some advertisements for job vacancies may ask you to apply in writing. In this case it is normal to send a copy of your CV with a covering letter. They will tell you if they need you to request an application form. Remember, even a telephone call to request an application will leave an impression, so do it well!

During an interview

Having a copy of your CV while you wait to be called in can help you refresh your memory. It is also advised that you leave a copy with the interviewer.

What to include

There is no set format for a CV, the style is personal choice, but you may find it useful to include the following:

Personal details

•	Name
•	Address
